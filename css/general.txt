
responsive webdesign 
to allow webpage to adapt current viewport width & height maybe use:
using %(vh/vw) instead of pc 
use max-width instead of width
use rem instead of px for most lengths
setting 1 rem to 10px for easy calculations
always use % for image dimensions together with max-width prop (for flexible images)
to change css styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints)(media queries)
easier way to make design responsive is to build - large screen code first and then write media queries for shrink design i.e for tablet or mobile,, smaller screens in general
